# Simon Chabrier - Forked Version: 1.0.0 compatible with Symfony 7.* and PHP 8.*

- This fork modernizes and adapts the original ConnectHolland CookieConsentBundle to be fully compatible with Symfony 7 and PHP 8.2+. The following improvements have been made:
- Replaced deprecated method calls (e.g., getRootAlias()) to comply with Symfony 7 and Doctrine ORM updates.
- Migrated all constructor property assignments to PHP 8+ promoted properties for cleaner and more concise code.
- Added native type declarations for all class properties and method signatures across the codebase.
- Replaced Doctrine annotations with native PHP 8 attributes for entity mapping.
- Added a doctrine.yaml example to the documentation for manually configuring Doctrine mapping, as the bundle is not treated as a traditional Symfony bundle (is_bundle: false).
- Optimized Doctrine entity fields by reducing string lengths where appropriate to limit unnecessary database resource consumption.
- Verified and updated all event subscriber method signatures to match Symfony 7â€™s event dispatching system.
- Maintained full feature parity with the original bundle while aligning the codebase with modern Symfony and PHP best practices.
- Applied light CSS refinements for improved margin and border rendering in the UI.
- See the "Doctrine mapping example for persisting cookie consent".

#### Doctrine mapping example for persisting cookie consent

To enable the `CookieConsentLog` entity and persist logs in your database, update your `doctrine.yaml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
mappings:
    CHCookieConsentBundle:
        type: attribute
        dir: "%kernel.project_dir%/vendor/connectholland/cookie-consent-bundle/Entity"
        prefix: 'ConnectHolland\CookieConsentBundle\Entity'
        alias: ch_cookie_consent_bundle
        is_bundle: false
```

-  Then update your database schema:
  
```bash
    bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

# Cookie Consent bundle for Symfony
Symfony bundle to append Cookie Consent to your website to comply to AVG/GDPR for cookies.

## Installation

### Step 1: Download using composer
In a Symfony application run this command to install and integrate Cookie Consent bundle in your application:
```bash
composer require connectholland/cookie-consent-bundle
```

### Step 2: Enable the bundle
When not using symfony flex, enable the bundle in the kernel manually:
```php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new ConnectHolland\CookieConsentBundle\CHCookieConsentBundle(),
        // ...
    );
}
```

### Step 3: Enable the routing
When not using symfony flex, enable the bundles routing manually:
```yaml
# app/config/routing.yml
ch_cookie_consent:
    resource: "@CHCookieConsentBundle/Resources/config/routing.yaml"
```

### Step 4: Configure to your needs
Configure your Cookie Consent with the following possible settings
```yaml
ch_cookie_consent:
    theme: 'light' # light, dark
    categories: # Below are the default supported categories
        - 'analytics'
        - 'tracking'
        - 'marketing'
        - 'social_media'
    use_logger: true # Logs user actions to database
    position: 'top' # top, bottom
    simplified: false # When set to true the user can only deny or accept all cookies at once
    http_only: true # Sets HttpOnly on cookies
    form_action: $routeName # When set, xhr-Requests will only be sent to this route. Take care of having the route available.
    csrf_protection: true # The cookie consent form is csrf protected or not
```

## Usage
### Twig implementation
Load the cookie consent in Twig via render_esi ( to prevent caching ) at any place you like:
```twig
{{ render_esi(path('ch_cookie_consent.show')) }}
{{ render_esi(path('ch_cookie_consent.show_if_cookie_consent_not_set')) }}
```

If you want to load the cookie consent with a specific locale you can pass the locale as a parameter:
```twig
{{ render_esi(path('ch_cookie_consent.show', { 'locale' : 'en' })) }}
{{ render_esi(path('ch_cookie_consent.show_if_cookie_consent_not_set', { 'locale' : app.request.locale })) }}
```

### Cookies
When a user submits the form the preferences are saved as cookies. The cookies have a lifetime of 1 year. The following cookies are saved:
- **Cookie_Consent**: date of submit
- **Cookie_Consent_Key**: Generated key as identifier to the submitted Cookie Consent of the user
- **Cookie_Category_[CATEGORY]**: selected value of user (*true* or *false*)

### Logging
AVG/GDPR requires all given cookie preferences of users to be explainable by the webmasters. For this we log all cookie preferences to the database. IP addresses are anonymized. This option can be disabled in the config.

### Themes

![Light Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConnectHolland/cookie-consent-bundle/master/Resources/doc/light_theme.png)

### TwigExtension
The following TwigExtension functions are available:

**chcookieconsent_isCategoryAllowedByUser**
check if user has given it's permission for certain cookie categories
```twig
{% if chcookieconsent_isCategoryAllowedByUser('analytics') == true %}
    ...
{% endif %}
```

**chcookieconsent_isCookieConsentSavedByUser**
check if user has saved any cookie preferences
```twig
{% if chcookieconsent_isCookieConsentSavedByUser() == true %}
    ...
{% endif %}
```


## Customization
### Categories
You can add or remove any category by changing the config and making sure there are translations available for these categories.

### Translations
All texts can be altered via Symfony translations by overwriting the CHCookieConsentBundle translation files.

### Styling
CHCookieConsentBundle comes with a default styling. A sass file is available in Resources/assets/css/cookie_consent.scss and a build css file is available in Resources/public/css/cookie_consent.css. Colors can easily be adjusted by setting the variables available in the sass file.

To install these assets run:
```bash
bin/console assets:install
```

And include the styling in your template:
```twig
{% include "@CHCookieConsent/cookie_consent_styling.html.twig" %}
```

### Javascript
By loading Resources/public/js/cookie_consent.js the cookie consent will be submitted via ajax and the cookie consent will be shown on top of your website while pushing down the rest of the website.

### Events
When a form button is clicked, the event of cookie-consent-form-submit-successful is created. Use the following code to listen to the event and add your custom functionality.
```javascript
document.addEventListener('cookie-consent-form-submit-successful', function (e) {
    // ... your functionality
    // ... e.detail is available to see which button is clicked.
}, false);
```

### Template Themes
You can override the templates by placing templates inside your project (except for Symfony 5 projects):

```twig
# app/Resources/CHCookieConsentBundle/views/cookie_consent.html.twig
{% extends '@!CHCookieConsent/cookie_consent.html.twig' %}

{% block title %}
    Your custom title
{% endblock %}
```

#### Template override for Symfony 5 projects
You can override the templates by placing templaces inside you project as below. Be careful, it is important to place templates at this location: "app/templates/bundles/CHCookieConsentBundle/" . 
```twig
# app/templates/bundles/CHCookieConsentBundle/cookie_consent.html.twig
{% extends '@!CHCookieConsent/cookie_consent.html.twig' %}

{% block intro %}
    Your custom intro
{% endblock %}
```
